# HackerOne Bug Report: Weak Cryptographic Implementation in Auth Module

## Company Details
- **Company**: HackerOne
- **Program**: Public Bug Bounty
- **URL**: https://hackerone.com
- **Severity**: Low to Medium
- **Bounty Range**: $100-$1,000

## Vulnerability Details
- **Type**: Weak Cryptographic Implementation
- **Location**: Authentication Module
- **Impact**: Potential compromise of user credentials

## Description
The authentication module uses weak cryptographic practices in password handling and token generation. While bcrypt is used for password hashing, there are several implementation issues that could weaken the overall security.

### Vulnerable Code
```python
def hash_password(password: str) -> bytes:
    """Insecure password hashing implementation"""
    if not isinstance(password, str):
        raise ValueError("Password must be a string")
        
    # Weak work factor
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=10)  # Too few rounds
    hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)
    return hashed
```

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Create a new user account
2. Inspect the stored password hash
3. Observe that:
   - Work factor is set too low (10 rounds)
   - No pepper is implemented
   - No additional key stretching

## Proof of Concept
```python
import bcrypt
import time

def test_hash_speed():
    password = "test_password"
    
    # Current implementation
    start = time.time()
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=10)
    hash1 = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)
    print(f"Time with 10 rounds: {time.time() - start}")
    
    # Recommended implementation
    start = time.time()
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=14)
    hash2 = bcrypt.hashpw(password.encode('utf-8'), salt)
    print(f"Time with 14 rounds: {time.time() - start}")

test_hash_speed()
```

## Impact
An attacker could:
1. Perform faster brute-force attacks due to low work factor
2. More easily crack password hashes if database is compromised
3. No additional protection from pepper if hashes are leaked

## Fix
Implement stronger cryptographic practices:

```python
import os
from typing import Tuple
import bcrypt

def hash_password(password: str) -> Tuple[bytes, bytes]:
    """Secure password hashing with pepper"""
    if not isinstance(password, str):
        raise ValueError("Password must be a string")
    
    # Generate a unique pepper for each password
    pepper = os.urandom(32)
    
    # Combine password with pepper
    secured_pass = f"{password}{pepper.hex()}".encode('utf-8')
    
    # Use stronger work factor
    salt = bcrypt.gensalt(rounds=14)  # Industry recommended minimum
    hashed = bcrypt.hashpw(secured_pass, salt)
    
    return hashed, pepper

def verify_password(password: str, stored_hash: bytes, pepper: bytes) -> bool:
    """Secure password verification"""
    if not all([isinstance(password, str), 
                isinstance(stored_hash, bytes),
                isinstance(pepper, bytes)]):
        raise ValueError("Invalid input types")
    
    # Reconstruct peppered password
    secured_pass = f"{password}{pepper.hex()}".encode('utf-8')
    
    # Verify in constant time
    return bcrypt.checkpw(secured_pass, stored_hash)
```

Also add these security measures:
1. Implement key stretching with PBKDF2
2. Add secure password requirements
3. Implement account lockout after failed attempts

## Additional Notes
While this vulnerability requires significant resources to exploit, it represents a fundamental security weakness that should be addressed. The fix:
1. Increases computational cost for attackers
2. Adds multiple layers of protection
3. Follows industry best practices
4. Has minimal performance impact on legitimate users

The implementation can be further strengthened by:
1. Regular security audits
2. Monitoring for brute force attempts
3. Implementing password rotation policies
4. Adding multi-factor authentication
