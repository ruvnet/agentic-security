# üèóÔ∏è Architecture

## System Overview
Agentic Security is an AI-powered security scanning and auto-fix pipeline that combines multiple security tools with AI capabilities to detect and remediate security vulnerabilities in code and web applications.

### Core Components
- **SecurityPipeline**: The main orchestrator that manages the security scanning and fixing process
- **CLI Interface**: A cyberpunk-styled command-line interface for interacting with the pipeline
- **Cache System**: Optimizes performance by caching scan results
- **AI Integration**: Leverages OpenAI GPT-4 and Claude for code analysis and fixes

## Data Flow
1. **Input Processing**
   - Configuration loading from YAML files
   - Environment validation
   - Path scanning configuration

2. **Security Scanning**
   - Code security checks
   - Web security scanning (ZAP, Nuclei)
   - Dependency vulnerability checking
   - Architecture review

3. **Analysis & Remediation**
   - Vulnerability severity assessment
   - AI-powered fix generation
   - Fix validation
   - Pull request creation

4. **Reporting**
   - Markdown report generation
   - Console output
   - Slack notifications

## Components

### Security Pipeline
The core engine that orchestrates:
- Security scanning operations
- AI-powered code analysis
- Fix implementation
- Result caching
- Report generation

### CLI Interface
Provides commands for:
- `scan`: Run security scans
- `analyze`: Analyze and fix security issues
- `run`: Execute complete pipeline
- `review`: Generate security reports
- `validate`: Configuration validation
- `test`: Run pipeline tests

### Cache System
- Stores scan results
- Implements validation logic
- Supports CI/CD pipeline optimization

### AI Integration
- Uses OpenAI GPT-4 for code review
- Leverages Claude for fix implementation
- Generates PR descriptions
- Performs architecture analysis

## Integration Points

### External Tools
- OWASP ZAP: Web security scanning
- Nuclei: Vulnerability scanning
- Dependency Check: Package vulnerability scanning

### AI Services
- OpenAI API
- Anthropic API

### Notification Services
- Slack webhooks for alerts

### Version Control
- Git integration for:
  - Branch creation
  - Fix implementation
  - PR generation

## Security Considerations
- Environment variable validation
- Secure API key handling
- Cache validation
- Fix validation before implementation
- Rate limiting for API calls
- Secure configuration handling
